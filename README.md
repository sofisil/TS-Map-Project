## Building a web app with Parcel

## Installation

Before we get started, you'll need to install Node and Yarn or npm, and create a directory for your project. Then, install Parcel into your app using Yarn:
```
yarn add --dev parcel
```
Or when using npm run:
```
npm install --save-dev parcel
```

Parcel has a development server built in, which will automatically rebuild your app as you make changes. To start it, run the parcel CLI pointing to your entry file:
```
yarn parcel index.html
```
Or when using npm run:
```
npx parcel index.html
```
